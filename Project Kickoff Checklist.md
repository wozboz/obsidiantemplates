Take max of 20 minutes for this! It's a first pass.
This should be done to make a plan for the project, not execute the project itself.

- [ ] Capture current thinking on the project
	- What do I already know about this project?
	- What don't I know that I need to find out?
	- What is my goal or intention?
	- Who can I talk to who might provide insights?
- [ ] Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes
	- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?
- [ ] Search for related terms across all folders
- [ ] Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder
- [ ] Create outline of collected notes and plan

## Possible additional questions
- [ ] What do I want to learn?
- [ ] What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question I want to answer?
- [ ] What is most likely to fail?
- [ ] What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful?
- [ ] What are minimum results I want to achieve?
